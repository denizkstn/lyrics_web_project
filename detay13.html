                <strong>Kashtan Annotation:</strong>
              Travis is calling out the girl for hiding her wild side but also pointing out that this girl isn’t into the usual flashy stuff like vacations and champagne. She’s not chasing luxury or trying to impress anyone, which makes her different from the crowd. That lowkey, down-to-earth vibe is probably what draws him to her.

Instead of the soft life, she’s about going all in. “Going hard in the paint” is a phrase from basketball that means giving something your full effort, no holding back. So she’s raw, real, and not afraid to get aggressive when it comes to getting what she wants.

This line is also a reference to Waka Flocka’s song “Hard in the paint”.

Couple of killers, I'm flyin' a private, I ain't even gotta go check my tool (Flocka)<br>

Walked in LV, ten chains, feelin' like a nigga just walked in ten deep (Yeah, JACKBOYS 2)<br>
Yeah, man, I swear these old niggas kill me (Baow, baow)<br>

[Chorus: Don Toliver & Waka Flocka Flame] <br>
This shit get intergalactic <br>

[Outro: Bun B]<br>
Paul and them, Paul and Juicy and them was the last niggas to fly<br>
'Cause they was not goin' nowhere without it<br>
And when the goddamn Excursion came, that was, nigga, that was it for them<br>
They damn sure wasn't flyin', 'cause now they can bring as many niggas as they want<br>
They got enough room for clothes, DJ turntables, sticks<br>
Weed, liquor, all that shit<br>
All in one motherfuckin' truck, nigga
