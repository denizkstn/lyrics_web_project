                <strong>Kashtan Annotation:</strong>
               Drake bragged about the women in his contacts list in similar fashion on “First Person Shooter” from his 2023 album For All The Dogs where he rapped:

I search one name, and end up seein' twenty tings
Nadine, Christine, Justine, Kathleen, Charlene, Pauline, Claudine
Man, I pack ‘em in this phone like some sardines

Just as it did then, this may interpolate the iconic second verse of “What These Bitches Want” by DMX from his 1999 classic album …And Then There Was X. In the verse, DMX lists out his romantic history by first names:

There was Brenda, Latisha, Linda, Felicia
Dawn, LeShaun, Ines and Alicia
Teresa, Monica, Sharon, Nicki
Lisa, Veronica, Karen, Vicky

This may also be an interpolation of the 2007 track “Shawty Is Da Shit” by The-Dream where featured artist Fabolous similarly asks:

Is it Keisha? Is it Tisha?
Maybe Lisa? Or Teresa?
It could be Tia, maybe Aaliyah

“Is it PARTY?” jokingly refers to the album’s other featured artist PARTYNEXTDOOR.

[Verse: Drake]<br>
The way I feel right now, I feel like we need to be all alone<br>
So if you just playin' around, you need to tell your girl, "Take your fine ass home," and that's real<br>
Stop teasin' me, yeah, what? Stop teasin' me<br>
I could change your life so easily<br>
I keep beggin' you to stay, but you're leavin' me<br>
Leavin' me, we got sticks in the club illegally<br>
Got the whole 6ix side, they believe in me<br>
We got members east of the DVP<br>
We got members west on the 401<br>
We had a lock on the game, but it's more to come<br>
You gotta pop that ass 'til the morning come<br>
You want shots for the girls? Then order some
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                [Pre-Chorus: Drake]<br>
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that?)<br>
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)<br>
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)<br>
Who's callin' my phone? (Who's callin' that shit?)<br>
Who's callin' my phone? (Who? Who?)<br>
Who's callin' my phone? (Who? Who?)<br>
Who's callin' my phone? (Who? Who?)<br>
Who's callin' my— (Ayy)

                [Verse: Drake]<br>
Ayy, how many hoes in this club?<br>
Is it just me and you, my love?<br>
I don't mean to call you no ho<br>
I just heard about the things that you do, my love<br>
And you're just like me, if it's true, my love, ayy<br>
You could see right through my love, ayy<br>
I see your waist shrunk, my love, ayy<br>
You got some bass in the trunk, my love, damn<br>
How many hoes in this club?<br>
Is it really just me, my love?<br>
You know my dad 'nem pimpin' for real<br>
You ever been down to Memphis, Tennessee, my love? Uh<br>
I ain't sayin' I agree, my love<br>
I'm just tellin' you the things that I see, my love<br>
I got drinks, jokes, sex, and cash<br>
Those are four things I can guarantee, my love, ayy
