[Verse 1: Don Toliver]<br>
I don't wanna lose my mind<br>
I don't wanna lose myself<br>
Tell me if I crossed a line<br>
I ain't tryna hurt myself<br>
Didn't wanna call your name<br>
Only got myself to blame, oh yeah
In my world, in my mind, always runnin' out of time<br>
In my love, in my heart, you're the only kryptonite<br>
But I, but I wait for you<br>
Still, I wait for you

<br>

                <strong>Kashtan Annotation:</strong>
               An “itchy trigger finger” is when the finger of a person is very eager to fire their weapon or likely to do so unexpectedly. Following the previous lines anticipating a new era, Doja Cat uses this metaphor to show that she’s back in the game and ready to attack.
               She then makes a wordplay with the word “gift,” as in a present that you can “wrap up” and give to someone else, and a natural ability or talent that continues to drive her career, which is nowhere near ending or “wrapping up.”
               inally, “ripped a new ribbon” is very likely a reference to the Creation myth, in which God takes a ribbon from Adam and uses it to give life to Eve, showing that Doja is similarly giving birth to a new herself.

[Chorus: Don Toliver]<br>
Yeah, it feels<br>
So good, I might just lose my mind<br>
No question if it's wrong or right<br>
Ain't no way to tell which way it's gonna go<br>
Yeah, but it feels<br>
So good, I might just lose my mind<br>
No question if it's wrong or right<br>
And now it's too late, no way to take it slow (Oh)<br>

[Instrumental Break]<br>

            <br>
            <p>
                [Verse 2: Doja Cat]<br>
Yeah<br>
Bounce back when bottles is on me<br>
I'm pushin' a new pen, rewritin' the story<br>
Hello to my old ways, goodbye to the nosebleeds<br>
You fightin' to stay here, you probably ODin'<br>
Ain't finna pop for no reason<br>
I don't throw shots, I run legions<br>
I been goin' over the top where no queen been<br>
Die with no regrets, this is my season<br>
Itch to pull trigger, gift that keep givin'<br>
None to wrap up, I ripped a new ribbon<br>
They wanted to catch up, wanted my good riddance<br>
You saw me at rock bottom, you wanted a new winner<br>
I paved the way for 'em<br>
Take the pain, doubled it, put it in wave form<br>
Safe to say trouble ain't what you was made for<br>
Keepin' the rang on<br>
I told 'em all game on the minute I came on
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                [Chorus: Doja Cat & Don Toliver, Don Toliver, Doja Cat]<br>
Yeah, it feels<br>
So good, I might just lose my mind<br>
No question if it's wrong or right<br>
Ain't no way to tell which way it's gonna go (Yeah)<br>
Yeah, it feels<br>
So good, I might just lose my mind<br>
No question if it's wrong or right<br>
And now it's too late, no way to take it slow (Oh)<br>
