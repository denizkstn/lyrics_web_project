Sun is shining, it's over<br>

Bathe yourself in the light, in your love<br>

                                [Verse 1: Playboi Carti & The Weeknd]<br>
Ever since I was a jit, knew I was the shit (Ooh, yeah)<br>
Shawty keep wanna come 'round, she wanna get hit (Wanna get hit so hard)<br>
She think she the main because I keep her by my side<br>
Double-O, bust down the watch, she know that I'm timeless (Timeless)<br>
I put my son in some Rick<br>
I pull that gun off the hip<br>
Pockets hold twenty-two clips (Ah)<br>
I break her heart, Comme Garçon<br>
Put on a shirt, get put on a blimp<br>
Bitch like a stain, get ready to lick<br>
I had to tеll her that ever sincе I was a jit, knew I was the shit (Oh)<br>
She singin' my songs, she wanna die lit, tryna get hit<br>
House like a bank, deposit this bitch, 'posit that check<br>
Smile on my face, ain't fearing shit, come and get checked (Uh)<br>
Ice on my neck, double-O wrist<br>
She in the Scat, hell of a 'Cat<br>
Fresh out the trench, four hundred packs<br>
Uh, yeah, I'm spinnin' in Paris (Uh)<br>
Dress for these hoes, they finna flock<br>
Just poured a four in a soda, it pop<br>
Them drugs finna hit, I'm feelin' ill<br>
I'm wrestlin' all of my demons, I feel like The Rock

                <strong>Kashtan Annotation:</strong>
               “She wanna die lit” is a reference to Carti’s 2018 debut studio album, Die Lit. Carti has called back to this title several times, notably for Solange’s 2019 track “Almeda”:

I'ma die lit, bitch, I promise (Hol' up)

As well, this woman’s obsession with Carti’s music means she wants to have sex with him, highlighted by the internal line rhyme of “lit” and “hit” that calls attention to this connection.

Oh, city on fire when I'm comin' home<br>

She hippie-flippin' a bean, she wanna fuck with the team<br>
She fell in love with the cream (Yeah), she fell in love with the scene<br>
Ooh, yeah, her man quiet, not a peep (Oh, nah)<br>
Broke his heart, PTSD (Oh, nah)<br>
Hold his chest, let it breathe<br>
