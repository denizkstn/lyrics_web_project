In this life, I gotta get rich, I can't be broke<br>
I was askin' favours and everyone tellin' me no<br>
Wait till the tables turn, we'll see who stays or goes<br>
I don't wanna be outside, I need someone that can keep me home<br>
Yo, I feel so close, but so far, go home or go hard?<br>
How can I stop when I come this far?<br>
I smile outside, deep down, I'm scarred<br>
They only see the results, the pain, they don't know the half

                <strong>Kashtan Annotation:</strong>
                Highlighting how there’s often no one around to support you when you’re starting your career and seeking help, but once the tables turn (symbolizing a reversal of power), it exposes those who only stick around when it’s convenient for them.

         <strong>[Verse 1: Kidwild]</strong><br>
This part of my life's redemption, I see it, I want it, we gеt it<br>
I still walk with God, but battlin' demons, in, I can't let them<br>
Thеy said that they love me, but I still don't know their intention<br>
I'm tryna live my dream, they offerin' P's, I don't wanna sell it<br>
She only look good in the edit<br>
They take, but they won't give credit<br>
The rumours spread like shotgun pellets<br>
I duck and dive 'cause they aim where my head is<br>
I couldn't care less if they like me<br>
What you think, that I do this for merits?<br>
Say what they want, don't address it, uh
So be, I let it
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>

            <p>
                <strong>[Chorus: Kidwild & Nemzzz]</strong><br>
In this life, I gotta get rich, I can't be broke<br>
I was askin' favours and everyone tellin' me no<br>
Wait till the tables turn, we'll see who stays or goes<br>
I don't wanna be outside, I need someone that can keep me home<br>
Yo, I feel so close, but so far, go home or go hard?<br>
How can I stop when I come this far?<br>
I smile outside, deep down, I'm scarred<br>
They only see the results, the pain, they don't know the half (Yo)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
               <strong>[Verse 2: Nemzzz]</strong><br>
Firm that loss, and said I'm okay<br>
But deep down, really, you know I was vex<br>
I give more than I ever get back<br>
I got my brothers, I don't need friends<br>
This sweet one don't know nothin' about me<br>
Still gonna give man head, ayy<br>
She want a brand-new body<br>
The IG hoes done got to her head<br>
Free my bro, we locked in like dreads<br>
That shit don't hurt me though<br>
Told bro, "We gotta stay on point"<br>
Can't get lined or burnt by a ho<br>
You man don't know who you are<br>
Band for band with me, you're slow<br>
Separately, you got nothin' to show<br>
Separately, I got back to the block<br>
(And it don't hit the same no more)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                                <strong>[Chorus: Kidwild]</strong><br>
In this life, I gotta get rich, I can't be broke<br>
I was askin' favours and everyone tellin' me no<br>
Wait till the tables turn, we'll see who stays or goes<br>

Yo, I feel so close, but so far, go home or go hard?<br>
How can I stop when I come this far?<br>
I smile outside, deep down, I'm scarred<br>
They only see the results, the pain, they don't know the half
