Yeah<br>

Girl, I can't decide if I should stay and say I tried<br>
Or I should leave and say goodbye<br>
It's killin' me inside<br>

                <strong>Kashtan Annotation:</strong>
             Drake rekindled his relationship with his father after years of estrangement around 2013, here he describes a relationship where they now get intoxicated together every night and talk.
Drake receives advice from his father to be cautious around women, warning him that the woman make like Drake for his fortune and fame but ultimately do not care about him. Even though Drake does not think this advice is sound, he still nods and agrees with his father.
Drake has previously described his father’s advice as less than helpful, like in 4PM in Calabasas when he says

“Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike”
Those my dad’s words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]<br>
If I could just get next to you, I'd probably be alright<br>
But we're so busy in this life<br>
We always say, "Some other time"<br>
Why won't my tears work? It's been a decade since I've cried<br>
I got no dog left in the fight<br>
The bark don't match the bite<br>
Me and my old man, we just get fucked up every night<br>
He said, "Son, these hoes just don't love you"<br>
I said, "I'll keep that in mind"<br>
Those ain't words to live by, wouldn't call that sound advice<br>
Our future doesn't sound too bright<br>
But I just nod and say, "You're right," I do
            </p>
            <br>
                       <p>
                
[Chorus: Drake]<br>
Girl, I can't decide if I should stay and say I tried<br>
Or I should leave and say goodbye<br>
It's killin' me inside
            </p> 

            <br>

                        <p>
                
[Post-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]<br>
And all my (My) presents to show my affection<br>
Flowers and diamonds and jets through the sky<br>
I'm not here to teach you a lesson (No)<br>
I'm just a caring and passionate guy<br>
Talks with your friends got you changin' your vibe<br>
Talks with your friends got you changin'<br>
Talks with your friends got you changin' your vibe<br>
Talking to your friends


            </p>
            
            <br>

            

                               <p>
                

[Chorus: Drake]<br>
Girl, I can't decide if I should stay and say I tried<br>
Or I should leave and say goodbye<br>
It's killin' me inside
            </p> 



            <br>


                                        
                        <p>
                
[Post-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]<br>
And all my (My) presents to show my affection<br><br>
Flowers and diamonds and jets through the sky
I'm not here to teach you a lesson (No)<br>
I'm just a caring and passionate guy<br>
Talks with your friends got you changin' your vibe<br>
Talks with your friends got you changin'<br>
Talks with your friends got you changin' your vibe<br>
Talking to your friends

            <br>


                        <p>
                
[Outro: Yebba]<br>
Ooh, another misunderstanding, of course<br>
I pushed you away 'cause that's what I could afford<br>
Ooh, we felt way too true and it hurts<br>
So laughing or crying will only make it worse
