                [Intro] <br>
Does my hair look beautiful? (Yeah) <br>
Do my titties look right? <br>
Think I can knock a boy off right now? <br>
              
            </p>

                                [Refrain: Drake]<br>
All the girls that's here for the truth<br>
Come put both hands on the DJ booth<br>
Then wine your waist to the big man sound

                <strong>Kashtan Annotation:</strong>
               In Caribbean dancing, “to wine” refers to the movement of your hips in a circular motion. It is derived from the word “winding”.

“Six-side” refers to the city of Toronto. The city is famously known as “The 6”, a nickname popularized by Drake. The name comes from the city’s six original municipalities and its area codes, 416 and 647.

“Yute” is Jamaican slang for youth or young people.

[Verse 1: Drake] <br>
And I get too stiff 'cause that ting's too round, good God <br>
Make me lift up your gown, but your face so sweet, wanna spin you around <br>
If I go link gang, I'll bring you around <br>
If I go to the bar, I'll bring you a round <br>
Which one? Which one? <br>
You're not like the tings you're around <br>
You're a real good girl, so I'm ringin' you down <br>
But come to the bed, I'll fling you around, weh <br>
These guys can't make songs for the gyal dem <br>
Trust me, this how the single should sound <br>
Fuck anyone that's bringing you down <br>
Sweetheart, you're doing your thing right now, good God
            </p>
            <br>
                       <p>

[Chorus: Drake]<br>
You want Cench or your ex, which one?<br>

            <p>
                [Verse 2: Central Cee]<br>
God forbid a girl's tryna have fun<br>
I got X if you wanna take drugs<br>
Do you wanna have sex or do you wanna make love?<br>
Which one? Which one? Which one? Which—<br>
Got a fairy ting and I got a witch one<br>
A G'd up ting that I bring sticks 'round<br>
And I've got a good girl, good girl, snitch one<br>
Too many gyal, now I gotta switch one<br>
Turn the hotel to a twenty-V-one<br>
Three-sixty, my head got spun<br>
Junk in the trunk, can see it from front<br>
Girl, your body is tea, it's pain, I'm sprung<br>
Your backside weighin' you down, one ton<br>
I got a chopstick for your wonton<br>
Tell me what you want, what you really, really want<br>
Put a coin in the slot, ya just hit jackpot
            </p>
            <br>

                               <p>

Put your head inna the pillow, face first<br>
Face first, face first, face first<br>
Ayy, face first, face first<br>
Put your head inna the pillow, face first<br>
I'm in the jam, know the mandem, burst<br>
You got makeup on the white shirt<br>
I wanna fuck out your face and skrrt<br>
You need to throw that ting inna reverse<br>
Then work, work, work, work, work<br>
Yeah, work, work, work, work, work<br>
Your last man broke your heart and it hurts<br>
You could cry out ya eye and curse<br>
You want diamond watch, you want purse<br>
You don't need swimsuit, take off your shirt<br>
Bend your back, gyal, don't say a word<br>
Face of a angel, I come like church<br>
I can't wait, girl, I'm not a waiter<br>
But you're sexy, you still get served<br>
I'm at the Claridge's in London, burst<br>
Put your head inna the pillow, face first
            </p>

                                           <p>
