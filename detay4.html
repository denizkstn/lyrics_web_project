                [Intro: The Weeknd]<br>
Begging on her knees to be popular<br>

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
     [Verse: Playboi Carti & DJ Swamp Izzo]<br>
First, I go whip out the boat, no, I can't hit on no brakes<br>
My life is out of control, I'm tellin' you, nobody safe<br>
I've been livin' my life limbo, my ice, it came with a tray<br>
I'm so high, I gotta hide my face, this not a rockstar phase<br>
I'm a emo thug in my faith<br>
Syrup, syrup, syrup, syrup, tell her to go change<br>
Monkey nuts on me, baby, I got on two chains<br>
Roll another blunt and I might motherfuckin' faint<br>
Spin on the block, have a pussy nigga stained<br>
I just put on my boots, I ain't worried 'bout no rain<br>
Put a nigga down, Channel 2 front page<br>
You was just askin' for some change, now you changed?<br>
Yeah, I told you, yeah, about that money, shit get strange<br>
Fully-loaded Jag, hold up, baby, Jordan paid<br>
I put duct tape on my switch, perfect aim<br>
They can't put me in no genre, baby, 'cause I changed the game<br>
We fuckin' on the same ho, but we not the same<br>
Disrespect the 5, I put your ass in the food chain (Swamp Izzo)<br>
Bitch keep callin' my phone, she sayin' Ms. Jackson goin' through her brain (Carti)<br>
We was just outside dancin', movin' off molly, feelin' insane (He's comin')<br>
I fucked the bitch so nasty, we go Sephora, yeah, then we go Pink<br>
She not so fuckin' toxic and she care 'bout what I think<br>
She's nothin' like no other bitches, she care 'bout what I drink<br>
I think she's a fling<br>
I think she's a playmaker, she should be on my team<br>
She should get her a ring<br>
Shit, it can't be me, but she can be on the team<br>
Diamonds, they come out the water, my sock, it come with a rink<br>
The Wraith came with the chauffeur, the chauffeur ready to take me
<br>
            </p>

                <strong>Kashtan Annotation:</strong>
               Carti is always changing his style when it comes to music and aesthetics. With Whole Lotta Red, Carti followed a punk-rap sound, yet with Music, he opts for Atlanta trap-sounding beats, developing a deeper vocal tone into his music.

“Changing the game” also refers to how Carti is influential with music and fashion, considering how popular he is, and the way he can maintain an aesthetic, almost like a brand.
