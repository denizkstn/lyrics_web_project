                [Intro: Elise Trouw & TKandz]<br>
Oh-oh<br>
Oh, oh-oh<br>
Oh, oh-oh<br>
Oh, oh-oh<br>
If I could do it, then why can't you? (Oh-oh)<br>
Oh, oh-oh<br>
Get up and make it work (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
              
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                                [Chorus]<br>
Yo, if I could do it, then why can't you? (Why?) Huh, get up and make it work<br>
Ain't no way that I'm sitting around, it's now or never, I'm picking it first (Yeah, I'm picking it first)<br>
You can't tell me that I won't make it, knew that I had this gift since birth (I knew)<br>
Grinding, came out the mud like Roddy, I had nobody, I came from dirt<br>
Still came far cah I put in the work (Yeah, yeah)<br>
Painting a picture when I write lyrics, don't call me a rapper, I'm really an artist<br>
This weren't by chance or luck, I took one shot and I hit my target (One shot)<br>
I'm not even yet in my prime, I'm not at a hundred yet, I'm still charging (Still charging)<br>
They don't wanna see me win, but I know in the end, I'm winning regardless
<br>
            </p>
            
           

           <br>
                

            <p>
                [Verse]<br>
Sleepless nights, I was up in the stu', up in the booth tryna make me a hit<br>
Even when I was feeling low, man, I kept on going, I weren't gon' quit<br>
I can't wait for the day that I make it, next in line, man, I feel like a king<br>
My time will come, I just gotta be patient, keep on pushing and take these risks<br>
I made raps off putting my pain on tracks, grinding hard tryna to see more plaques (Plaques)<br>
I've been going harder than ever, I don't have time to sit and relax (I don't)<br>
I've been putting in countless hours, I still not near where I wanna be at (Not yet)<br>
This year, I'ma prove them wrong, they said that I can't, but I know that I can
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                
[Chorus]<br>
If I could do it, then why can't you? Huh, get up and make it work<br>
Ain't no way that I'm sitting around, it's now or never, I'm picking it first (Yeah, I'm picking it first)<br>
You can't tell me that I won't make it, knew that I had this gift since birth (I knew)<br>
Grinding, came out the mud like Roddy, I had nobody, I came from dirt<br>
Painting a picture when I write lyrics, don't call me a rapper, I'm really an artist (I'm more than rap)<br>
This weren't by chance or luck, I took one shot and I hit my target<br>
I'm not even yet in my prime, I'm not at a hundred yet, I'm still charging (Still charging)<br>
They don't wanna see me win, but I know in the end I'm winning regardless<br>
If I could do it, then why can't you? Huh, get up and make it work<br>
Ain't no way that I'm sitting around, it's now or never, I'm picking it first (I ain't sitting around)<br>
You can't tell me that I won't make it, knew that I had this gift since birth (I knew)<br>
Grinding, came out the mud like Roddy, I had nobody, I came from dirt
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>
                [Outro]<br>
Grinding, came out the mud like Roddy, I had nobody, I came from dirt<br>
