Yo, come on, Mitch, you know I gotta go<br>
Bring your motherfuckin'—

                                [Chorus: Central Cee & 21 Savage]<br>
If it weren’t the UK, would've had a AK-47 with a hundred rounds<br>
Red carpet in my trackie and Air Max, they want a boy with a London style<br>
We ain't got generational wealth, got a couple of mill’ for my unborn child<br>
If I pay a man a hundred thousand pound, I can get man bun right in front of a crowd, uh<br>
That's GBP, the price go up if it's USD<br>
Better watch your words, I'll get you X'd 'bout the shit you tweet (On God)<br>
I told lil' bro if it's personal, he better jump out and do it on feet<br>
We got somethin’ in common with scuba divers, why? ’Cause the guys in deep
<br>

                <strong>Kashtan Annotation:</strong>
               This line is interpolated from a Central Cee’s 2024 COLORS SHOW performance of “One By One”:

If it weren’t the UK, would’ve had an AK
If it was America, I would’ve had a Draco

Cench also used these lines on his 2021 unreleased freestyle “Meme Page”:

If it weren’t the UK, would of had a AK
But we got spinners and baby nines

The UK has strict gun control laws, making it difficult to acquire firearms like assault rifles. In a place with easier access to guns, he would have had high-powered weapons, like an AK-47 with extended magazines (“a hundred rounds”). The UK law requires a firearms license and background checks conducted by local police before anyone can legally own a gun.

The country’s heavily monitored borders make it difficult to smuggle firearms into the UK. As a result, most guns in circulation are old and previously owned, often making them unreliable. Acquiring a powerful and widely recognized rifle like an AK-47 is nearly impossible, as major producers like Russia, the United States, and China face significant barriers when attempting to supply such weapons to the UK.

[Verse 1: Central Cee]<br>
If it weren't the UK, would’ve had an AK, gang outside with a samurai sword<br>
Nike Tech fleece with the Air Force 1, my ski mask on, but we don't snowboard<br>
Go on a glide, leave your phone at home, what's wrong with these guys? They go and record<br>
So distraught, we was broke as hell, well, until we broke the law<br>
If I lived in Harlem, I would've been Mitch, them man would’ve been like Ace and snitched<br>
If it was Oakland, I would've been a pimp<br>
If it was 1930, North Carolina, I would've been Frank with the mink<br>
If the opps got nominated for the Brits, would've went to the ceremony with sticks<br>
And the G17 would've came with a switch
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
 
[Chorus: Central Cee & 21 Savage]<br>

If I pay man a hundred thousand pound, I can get man bun right in front of a crowd, uh (Pussy)<br>
That's GBP, the price go up if it's USD (21)<br>
Better watch your words, I'll get you X'd 'bout the shit you tweet (On God)<br>

Alright, if it weren't the UK, would've had an AK-47 with a hundred rounds<br>
