                <strong>Kashtan Annotation:</strong>
               This could reference measurements, possibly describing an idealized figure. “Eight by eight” could symbolize a specific shape or 8x8 car, while “thirty-six” might relate to body proportions. “Zero waist” suggests a very slim or small waist.

[Verse 1: Lil Baby & Travis Scott]<br>
Two hundred hoes, thirty black trucks<br>
All of us known for puttin' on that stuff<br>
I let her go, ain't no handcuffs<br>
I get a hard-on when them bands come (Yeah)<br>
These niggas too loose, need to tighten up<br>
Took her to Hermès, got her items up<br>
Boy, they done fucked up and let Spider home<br>
Free the guys down the road gotta hide the phone<br>
Got my name from the street, not a microphone<br>
Ain't no sleep, she on two, I took Adderall<br>
Niggas act like they us, but they not at all<br>
Copped the baddest shit out, we forgot the car (Yeah)<br>
I put diamonds in my teeth like I'm Paul Wall<br>
Pretty titties, her whole body so soft<br>
Hold the back of her head 'til her jaws lock<br>
I don't care what he do, he a cornball<br>
Extra layers, I'm dressin', I'm Stiff Gang<br>
I'm the real one, two million on pinky ring<br>
Come through pimpin' like Pinky without the cane<br>
Niggas thinkin' they hot, but they Eddie King<br>
I've been puttin' on this stuff since my baby frame<br>
Walk around with a dollar, that's pocket change<br>
Niggas think that you smart 'til you knock his brain<br>
I done Brabus'd the Rover like I'm La Flame<br>
Me and Ski tryna see who the colder shit<br>
If I see her with bro, I don't know the bitch<br>
Extra stuff every time, extra stuff every time<br>
Extra stuff every time when I'm steppin' out<br>
Put on stuff every time, put on stuff every time<br>
Put on stuff every time when I'm steppin' out
            </p>
            <br>
                       <p>
                
[Chorus: Travis Scott]<br>
Eight by eight, thirty-six, zero waist<br>
Me-on-three my type of date<br>
All this stuff, I might be late (It's lit)<br>
It's all this stuff, I eight by eight (Straight up)<br>
Stuff, it's stuff, it's stuff<br>
Stuff, it's stuff, it's stuff (It's stuff)<br>
Stuff, it's stuff, it's stuff (It's stuff, woo)<br>

            </p>

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]<br>
Breakin' the nine<br>
Inside the spot, you know three of them mine<br>
Live like 1 OAK, it ain't one of a kind, three of a kind<br>
Put on my ice, now all three of 'em blind<br>
I put grease in my soda, I'm tryna get fried<br>
She rockin' that outfit, she tryna get hired<br>
Rubbers on rubbers, I never get tired<br>
Bought her that ice and I know she still lyin'<br>
Brought number one on the plane 'cause she fly<br>
Bought number two a new whip, she got drive<br>
Bought number three a new Guc', she suck dick<br>
Bought number four a new stick 'cause she fire<br>
Bought number five Chanel 5<br>
No. 5, No. 5, No. 5, No. 5, No. 5<br>
Yeah, one at a time, yeah (One of a kind)<br>
Yeah, yeah, bring 'em all, all, all of 'em<br>
Yeah (Woo)
            </p>
